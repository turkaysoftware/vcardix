# How to use VCardix?

After downloading the VCardix application, you will find two options: **VCardix_x64.exe** and **VCardix_arm64.exe**. Which file to choose depends on your computerâ€™s processor architecture. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you decide which version is right for you:

#### 1. VCardix_x64.exe
- **VCardix_x64.exe** is designed for computers with an x64 (64-bit) processor architecture.
- If youâ€™re using a standard Windows PC or laptop, you likely need the x64 version.
- Most devices with Intel or AMD processors use the x64 architecture.

#### 2. VCardix_arm64.exe
